                My initial plan was to create an application where a user could
                upload a photo of a bookshelf full of books. My app would then use
                image recognition and machine learning to identify the specific 
                edition of each and every book in the photo. It would then automatically add 
                all of those books to the user's database.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I didn't even make it past "Part One: Scratching my head..." 
                before I realized that I should probably scale back the idea a bit
                seeing as this is my first proper website. So I decided not to abandon
                my initial idea, but to instead build the application in stages. Stage 
                one, the goal of this project, would be to create a website where users
                can search for books and add them to their bookcases. Simple as that, or
                so I thought.

            <p>
                At this point three months into my learning journey, I have a basic
                understanding of HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, and JavaScript. I've also
                started using the basic functionality of Git and GitHub. I learned
                the Flask basics in Week 9 of CS50x where I completed the infamous
                "Finance" problem set. Despite that, I felt overwhelmed by the
                thought of creating my own Flask application from scratch. I took a
                step back and followed along with some tutorials. I also actually
                read the documentation for Flask and Jinja. This was a bit of a
                milestone in that previously I'd try to read the documentation for a
                library or framework and it would be like reading a foreign
                language. This time, I was able to understand the documentation and
                use it to my advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                By far the most helpful tutorials I found were by Youtubers
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Bitfumes">@bitfumes</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/techwithtim">@TechWithTim</a>. I
                greatly appreciate their help in getting many concepts to finally
                start clicking for me.

                Armed with a better understanding of Flask, I was able to start
                building my application. I created my repository
                "bookcase-database" and got to work thinking about the bones of
                the project, its

          <h3>(aka WTF is a virtual environment)</h3>
          <div class="part-content">
            <p>
              As soon as I started reading about creating web applications with
              Flask, I kept seeing the term "virtual environment" pop up. I had
              no idea what this was, but I knew I needed to figure it out. I did
              some reading and asked ChatGPT some questions.
            </p>

            <p>
              I learned that a virtual environment is a way to isolate your
              project from the rest of your computer. This is useful because it
              allows you to install packages and libraries specific to your
              project without affecting the rest of your computer. Once I
              understood and figured out how to create a venv and activate it, I
              found it incredible useful. I appreciate being able to view all
              the packages I've installed for a project and know they're not
              some unrelated package installed on my computer that I don't
              understand the purpose of (there's still a lot of those). So for
              me with this first project at least, the real value of using a
              venv was the ability to use "pip list" and "pip freeze >
              requirements.txt". This formed the beginning of my understanding
              of dependencies and requirements. Much later in the project, I
              learned that virtual environments are also useful for deploying
              your application.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
              I was able to get the venv up and running on the first day of
              working on the project. I think the highlight of this part was
              when I created my first bash script that actually proved useful.
              All it did was save me a few seconds of typing "source
              venv/bin/activate" but it was a proud moment for me. This script
              would evolve a bit over the course of the project to include
              exporting environment variables (which was another foreign concept
              to me at this point).

          <h3>Actually, I think it's pronounced "Skewl"</h3>
          <div class="part-content">
            <p>
              The next step was creating a database. I decided to use SQLite for
              this project. I had used it before in CS50x and it seemed like a
              good choice for a small project like this. I also decided to use
              SQLAlchemy as an ORM. I didn't know what that was until I started
              preparing for this project. I learned that an ORM is an Object
              Relational Mapper. It's a tool that allows you to interact with a
              database using objects and methods instead of SQL queries. I
              decided to use an ORM because I thought it would be a good
              learning experience. I also thought it would be useful to know how
              to use an ORM for future projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              I loved the SQL week of CS50x and I was excited to get to use SQL
              again. I knew my database would need a table for users, a table
              for books, and a table for bookcases. I connected the bookcase
              table to the user table through the "owner_id". This means that
              each bookcase would belong to one user. A user can have many
              bookcases, but each bookcase can only belong to one user. I used a
              many-to-many relationship between the bookcase table and the book
              table. This means that a bookcase can have many books and a book
              can be in many bookcases. I used a join table called
              "bookcase_book" to connect the two tables. This table has a
              bookcase_id and a book_id.
            </p>

            <p>
              I used the "flask db migrate" command to create a migration file.
              I then used the "flask db upgrade" command to apply the migration
              to my database. I was able to use the "flask shell" command to
              test out my database. I was able to create a user, bookcase, and
              book and add the book to the bookcase. I was also able to query
              the database to get the books in a bookcase and the bookcases a
              user owns. I used the "flask db downgrade" command to undo the
              migration and start over. I did this a few times as I made changes
              to my database. Though much of the time, I just opened a second
              terminal and used the "sqlite3" command to open the database and
              make changes that way.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to connect the database to my flask project, I created a
              "models.py" file. I imported SQLAlchemy and created a db object. I
              then imported the db object into my "app.py" file and initialized
              it. I also imported the db object into my "auth.py" file so I
              could begin the next stage of the project: user authentication
              (dun dun dun).

              Before I started this part of the project, I used Jinja to create
              a base.html file and a home.html file. I used the "extends" and
              "block" keywords to create a base template that I could extend to
              other pages. I also created a "static" folder for CSS and
              JavaScript files, and a "templates" folder for all the HTML files.

            <p>
              Thanks to <a href="https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/flask">TechWithTim's Flask tutorials</a>, I was
              able to get user authentication up and running pretty quickly. I
              created a "auth.py" file and imported the db object from my
              "models.py" file. I created a User class and a Bookcase class. I
              used the UserMixin class from Flask-Login to add some useful
              methods to my User class. I created a login_manager object and
              initialized it in create_app() function inside my __init__.py
              file. I created a login.html file and a register.html file, along
              with a login route and a register route. I used the "flask-login"
              extension to create a login_required decorator for my routes and
              finally created a logout route.

              Flask-Login was fairly straight forward to use. As I type this I'm
              trying to think of issues I had setting this up, but I can't think
              of any. I think the only part I remember struggling to understand
              was the "current_user" variable. But turns out it's just a
              variable that stores the current user...duh. I guess I just
              expected more steps to make that work.
            </p>

            <p>
              Oh! I almost forgot, password hashing! I used the
              "werkzeug.security" module to hash passwords. I used the
              "generate_password_hash" function to hash the password when a user
              registers. I then used the "check_password_hash" function to check
              the password when a user logs in. Easy peasy.

          <h3>Routes, views, adding books manually</h3>
          <div class="part-content">
            <p>
              This portion of the project was a bit of a blur. Once I got the
              user authentication working and I was able to direct users to the
              home page, I repeated that process, using @login_required as
              needed, for most of the pages that I wanted to create.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once I finished creating all the routes, views and templates for
              the pages I wanted, I created a form to create bookcases and a
              form to manually add books to a bookcase. I ran into a few hurdles
              during this part of the project. That pesky "current_user"
              variable was one of them. I had to figure out how to pass the
              current user's id to the bookcase form so that I could connect the
              bookcase to the user and how to pass the current bookcase's id to
              the book form so that I could connect the book to the bookcase. I
              went in circles for a bit with ChatGPT but finally realized I
              could use hidden inputs to pass the ids.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was very pleased to have the basic structure and functionality
              of the application up and running. At this point, I was able to
              create a user, login, logout, create a bookcase, add books to the
              bookcase, and view the book information on the /bookcase page. I
              was also able to view all the bookcases a user owns on the
              /bookcases page, as well as details about each individual book on
              the /book page.

          <h3>How to use API's</h3>
          <div class="part-content">
            <p>
              I knew I wanted to use the Google Books API to get book
              information for my application. I had no idea how to use an API or
              how to get an API key. I did some reading and watched some videos
              and I was able to get a basic understanding of how API's work. I
              learned that an API is a set of functions and procedures that
              allow the creation of applications that access data and features
              of another service. I learned that an API key is a unique
              identifier that's used to authenticate a user, developer, or
              program to an API. I learned that API keys are used to track and
              control how the API is being used, for example to prevent
              malicious use or abuse of the API.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is also the part where I had to learn about environment
              variables. I learned that environment variables are variables that
              are set in the operating system or in the terminal. They store
              information that is used by applications. When I was developing
              locally, I just used a bash script to activate my venv and export
              my environment variables. However, later before I deployed the
              website, I ended up using the "python-dotenv" module to create a
              .env file and store my environment variables.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start with, I created a search form with three fields -- title,
              author, and isbn. I created a route for the search form and a view
              to handle the form data. I used the requests module to make a GET
              request to the Google Books API. The hardest part was figuring out
              how to format the search query itself. I ended up using
              "f-strings" to format the query and .join() to join each word in
              the query with a "+". Once I got the search results back, I was
              able to display them on the search page along with a thumbnail
              image of each book's cover. I also added a button to each book
              that would allow the user to add the book to their bookcase.
            </p>

            <p>
              But then I ran into a problem. How do I actually add the book to
              the database? Seeing as I already had a working form to manually
              add books, I realized all I had to do was create an invisible form
              for each book in the search results and use those hidden inputs to
              pass the data to the /add_book route.

          <h3>Adding CSS Styling to Bring My Website to Life</h3>
          <div class="part-content">
            <p>
              Yeah. Coming into this project, CSS was actually one of my
              favorite parts of web development. It still is, but now I have
              learned that I need to be more organized with my CSS. When I
              started working on the CSS, I created a file within the /static
              folder called "styles.css". I figured one document would be
              plenty. Despite there being eleven different HTML pages on my
              website at this point, I figured each page was similar enough that
              it wouldn't be a problem. I was wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the time I finished the "global" styling and navbar CSS, I was
              already nearing 400 lines of code. "Not much more" thought the
              inexperienced developer. I was wrong. I was so wrong. I was so, so
              wrong. I was so, so, so wrong. I was so, so, so, so wrong. Like
              1,714 lines of code wrong. whoops.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was probably about halfway through the fever dream of CSS when I
              realized my mistake. It started with one of the very first classes
              I created -- ".container-home". Why did I do that right after I
              was thinking about how each page would be so similar? I don't
              know. But by the time I realized my mistake, I was too far down
              this road to turn back. I had to finish what I started. I embraced
              the chaos. I felt like a mad scientist. I was a mad scientist. I
              was a mad scientist and my CSS was my monster. I was Victor
              Frankenstein and my CSS was my monster. I was Victor Frankenstein
              and my CSS was my monster and I was the monster. I was the
              monster. I was the monster.
            </p>

            <p>
              Honestly, once I committed to just letting it fly and not worrying
              about the mess, I had a blast with the CSS. Do I regret not
              keeping things more organized from the start? Absolutely. Will I
              take the time to learn about SASS and CSS best practices before my
              next project? Absolutely. But I'm still proud of the CSS I created
              for this project. I think it looks pretty good. And I'm especially
              proud of the little touches I managed to add, such as the dynamic
              navbar.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final thing I have in my notes for this part of the project is
              -- "Fuck Bootstrap". To be fair, I didn't really give it much of a
              chance. But without taking the time to dive into understanding
              Bootstrap, I was feeling very confined by the framework, so opted
              to do things "freehand".

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
              I learned that despite feeling more confident with CSS than any
              other language when I started this project, my understanding is
              still rudimentary at best. I've got a lot left to learn about CSS.
              I need to figure out a better workflow and methodology to keep
              things much more organized. My finger is still sore from scrolling
              around that god forsaken page. I've seen SASS come up a lot, so
              I'll start my googling there before my next project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel like I owe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell">Kevin Powell</a> an apology for my
              butchering of this CSS. I'm sorry, Kevin. This does NOT reflect on
              Kevin's tutorials which I have found to be incredibly helpful. In fact, without his tutorials, 
              I can't even imagine what my website and CSS file would look like. I'll be better next time!

          <h3>Testing, Debugging, and Missing Features</h3>
          <div class="part-content">
            <p>
              I was nearing the end of the project and I was feeling pretty good
              about it. I had a working application that I was proud of. I had
              learned a lot and I was excited to deploy it. But I knew I had to
              test it first.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by testing the routes and views. I went through each
              page and made sure everything was working as expected. I made a
              list of all the features I wanted to test and checked them off the
              list one by one. I ran into problems immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, I decided to make the username case-insensitive so that
              "JohnDoe" and "johndoe" would be the same username, while the
              database remembers the capitalization that the user used when they
              registered. I also adjusted the login route code to allow for the
              user to enter their Email Address or username.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next problem that I encountered was on the /search page. My
              application displays a list of all the books that match the user's
              search query. Each book has a button that allows the user to add
              the book to their bookcase. I noticed that if the user clicked the
              button to add the book to their bookcase, the book would be added
              to the database, but the page would refresh and the search results
              would disappear. I decided to figure out a way to refresh the page
              with the same search results after the user added a book. I was
              able to accomplish this by passing the search query to the
              /add_book route and then passing the search query back to the
              /search route with render_template().
            </p>
            <p>
              It was during testing that my sloppy CSS came back to bite me a
              few times. I spent too much time trying to figure out why one
              button wasn't styled correctly, or one form didn't have the right
              box shadow, etc. This just reinforced the need for me to learn
              more about CSS and how to keep things organized.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the edit_book.html page, I have a form with inputs and
              textareas for all the forward facing book information. For the
              "user rating" field I used a select element with options for 1-5
              stars and a checkbox for "read". It took me a while to finally get
              this working as intended. I had to figure out how to pass the
              current user rating and read status to the form. I ended up more
              hidden input fields to actually hold the necessary values then
              used JavaScript to pass these values to the correct fields.

              I was exterminating bugs and adding features left and right,
              breezing through the testing phase. I was feeling pretty good
              about myself until I got to the last item on my list -- "Allow
              users to change their password". I had no idea how to do this, and
              I didn't consider this functionality during the planning phase. So
              back to the drawing board I went.

              Test Driven Development: This is a concept that was covered in
              CS50x, but while I understand the concept of TDD, I do not
              understand how to implement it. I think this is something I need
              to learn more about before my next project along with PyTest.

          <h3>
            Flask_Mail, itsdangerous, tokens, secrets, SMTP, serialized
            tokens...ahhh
          </h3>
          <div class="part-content">
            <p>
              I added a "Forgot Password?" link to the login page. I decided to
              break this task up into two parts. First I would figure out how to
              use Flask-Mail to send an email to the user with a link to a page
              where they could change their password. Then I would figure out
              how to make this link secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Configuring Flask-Mail was fairly straight forward. I initially
              created a Mail object and configured mail within my app.py file.
              But because of my project's file structure, I ended up creating
              the object within the __init__.py file's create_app() function. I
              also added another two environment variables to my .env file, one
              for the gmail username and one for the password. I used the "os"
              module once again to access these environment variables.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next step wasn't quite as simple. I started by installing the
              Python "secrets" module and the "itsdangerous" library. I used
              secrets to create a secret key for the token and used itsdangerous
              to create a token that would be sent to the user's email address.
              I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to discern the
              differences between 'TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer' and
              'URLSafeTimedSerializer', and figuring out how it all actually
              works. My biggest issue was trying to set the expiration time
              within the parameters of the URLSafeTimedSerializer object. I must
              have come across some post or maybe copilot (yea you) suggested I
              use "expires_in" within the parameters of the object when I was
              creating it. But turns out, I had to use "max_age" as an argument
              for the loads() method when I was decoding/authenticating the
              token. I enjoyed troubleshooting this bug as it was one of the
              first times I felt comfortable following along with a more
              "advanced" topic in Stack Overflow threads.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a genuinely great feeling when I heard my phone ding right
              after testing the reset password functionality and saw an email
              from "BookcaseDatabase@gmail.com" with a link to reset my
              password. I clicked the link, entered a new password, and was
              redirected to the login page. The new password worked!

        <h3>Deployment!!! (and a few more bugs)</h3>
        <div class="part-content">
          <p>
            Throughout my time working on the project there were a few moments
            where I stopped and wondered how certain parts of the project would
            work when I deployed it. I knew I would have to figure out how to
            use environment variables outside of running my little bash script
            each time I activated the virtual environment. I'd have to figure
            out how to use a different database and how to connect it to my
            application. But to start with I had to be able to answer the
            question -- "How do I deploy a Flask application?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Right off the bat, I kept seeing the same few options repeated over
            and over. PythonAnywhere, Heroku, Docker and AWS. But first I
            decided to finally figure out what "WSGI" meant. I knew that Flask
            was defined as a "WSGI" framework, but I had no idea what that
            meant. One quick google search later and I had my answer -- "Web
            Server Gateway Interface". I learned that WSGI is a specification
            for a universal interface between web servers and web apps. In other
            words, it's a way for a web server to communicate with a web
            application.
          </p>
          <p>
            I flipped a four sided coin and decided to go with PythonAnywhere. I
            followed step by step instructions on their website and was able to
            get my site up and running fairly quickly. I used the "git clone"
            command to clone my project from GitHub directly into
            PythonAnywhere. The only thing that gave me a little trouble was
            setting up and using python-dotenv and getting the virtual
            environment within PythonAnywhere to include the dependencies I
            needed. I had some trouble getting pipreqs to work, but I found a
            post on Stack Overflow where the author answered their own question.
            Turns out that because my .venv/ folder is in my main directory,
            pipreqs was looking for all the dependencies within that folder
            which was causing it to generate a weird requirements.txt file. I
            fixed this by using the pipreqs option '--ignore' when executing the
            command.
          </p>
          <p>
            I shouldn't have been so stressed about the deployment process. It
            ended up being very straight forward. The only other issue that I
            encountered had to do with Flask Mail (yet again). I mentioned this
            in the previous section, but this is when I actually had to move my
            initialization of the Mail object from my app.py file to my
            __init__.py file. I also had to change the way I was importing the
            Mail object in my auth.py file. This was the first time I actually
            began to feel like I understand how Python imports work.
